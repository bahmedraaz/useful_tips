Error: ERROR: Failed building wheel for onnx
Failed to build onnx
ERROR: Could not build wheels for onnx, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects

Solution: onnx does not have wheel files available for Python 3.12.
This essentially leaves you two options (without introducing other accents such as docker):
1. Use Python 3.11 instead
2. Install whatever is necessary so you are able to build the onnx package from source
