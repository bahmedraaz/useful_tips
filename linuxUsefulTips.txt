**Problem2: 
  How to remove the locked file named 4913?

Solution: 
  This is not a real file, since it does not show up in a directory listing (That is why I hadn’t spotted it before), and since it doesn’t exist, it can’t be deleted. However, it   can be opened with another text editor such as gedit. If you do this, type in a character, and save, then the file takes on a real existence; it is no longer locked, and can be    deleted in the usual way. Moreover, if you don’t do this but use vi again, the mysterious 4913 disappears; it seems to be toggled by the use of the editor.
