How to fix this error?
"error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

Why does this error occur?
This is because the tool you are trying to run is 32 bit, but the platform is 64 bit.
To be specific, in this case, I was trying to run the tool calle features (creates features from a cnf file) and it is 32 bit application.

If you want to run a 32 bit application to a 64 bit platform, you have to have the multi-architecture support in your platform. In summary, to fix the above problem, 
follow the steps below.

1. To check the architecture of the system type the following command
    command: dpkg --print-architecture
    output: In my virtual machine, it prints, amd64
    
    This means, your platform is 64 bit architecture
    
2. Add 32 bit architecture. To do that, run the following command
    Command: sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    
3. Check if the 32 bit architecture is added.
    Command: sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    Output: i386
    
4. Install the 32-bit library for which you are getting the error.
    Command:  sudo apt-get update
              sudo apt-get install libstdc++5:i386
              
The eror should go away....
