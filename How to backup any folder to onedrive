--How to backup any folder to onedrive?

Solution: Usually onedrive is capable of syncing Desktop, Documents and Picture folder. You just have to drag and drop this folder to onedrive, they will automatically be backed up.
However, to backup other folder, you have to follow the step below.

Create hard link between a folder in onedrive and the folder you want to take backup.
  Example Command: mklink /j "C:\Users\BAHMED\OneDrive - University of Florida\computerBackup" "C:\myDrive\testFolder" 
This command will create this folder : "C:\Users\BAHMED\OneDrive - University of Florida\computerBackup", which will be used to backup this folder "C:\myDrive\testFolder".

Note that if you already create "C:\Users\BAHMED\OneDrive - University of Florida\computerBackup" before running the above command, it will give you an error.

Now, if you want to delete the hardlink, simply delete the backup folder, the target folder will not be affected. You can manually delete or use the command. An example command to 
delete "C:\Users\BAHMED\OneDrive - University of Florida\computerBackup" in windows is shown below.

rmdir "C:\Users\BAHMED\OneDrive - University of Florida\computerBackup"
