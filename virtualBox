Problem: 
  File permission issues with shared folders under Virtual Box:

Solution 1
  Run "sudo adduser $USER vboxsf" from terminal.
  (On Suse it's sudo usermod --append --groups vboxsf $USER)

  To take effect you should log out and then log in, or you may need to reboot.

Solution 2
  Edit the file /etc/group (you will need root privileges). Look for the line vboxsf:x:999 and add at the end :yourusername -- use this solution if you don't have sudo.
  To take effect you should log out and then log in, or you may need to reboot.
