The % key can be used for the following:
	To jump to a matching opening or closing parenthesis, square bracket or a curly brace: ([{}])
	To jump to start or end of a C-style comment: /* */.
	To jump to a matching C/C++ preprocessor conditional: #if, #ifdef, #else, #elif, #endif.
	To jump between appropriate keywords, if supported by the ftplugin file, for example, between begin and  end in a Pascal program.

	A nice keymap is: noremap % v%
	This way, whenever you type % you jump to the matching object, and you visually select all the text in between.
