--How to embed fonts in pdf while compiling with pdfLaTeX in overleaf
First, add a file called latexmkrc (without extensions) to your project, and then paste the following line in that file:
$pdflatex = 'pdflatex %O %S; ps2pdf14 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress %B.pdf %B-embed.pdf; mv %B-embed.pdf %B.pdf';

You may have to make some kind of small change in your .tex file to trigger a re-compilation and the post-processing to happen.
N.B. This will not only embed the fonts but also compress too much. Some images might get affected. To avoid this you can type the following line in latexmkrc file

$pdflatex = 'pdflatex %O %S; ps2pdf14 %B.pdf %B-embed.pdf; mv %B-embed.pdf %B.pdf';
