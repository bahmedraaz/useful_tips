So to prevent this just run the following code in the console and it will prevent you from disconnecting.

Ctrl+ Shift + i to open inspector view . Then goto console.

function ClickConnect(){
console.log("Working"); 
document.querySelector("colab-toolbar-button#connect").click() 
}
setInterval(ClickConnect,60000)
It would keep on clicking the page and prevent it from disconnecting.
