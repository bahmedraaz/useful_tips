To get help: <command> -help
To go to man page: man <command>

report_design
set_register_type -exact -flip_flop <flip_flop type from the library>

report_cell
report_cell [all_registers]
report_cell {U2}


report_reference

get_references <reference Name>
For example: get_references AO21X1 (returns the collection of instances of AO21X1)
             get_references INV*    (returns the collection of instances of INV*)

report_cell [get_references INV*]

To get the attribute of any cell
get_attribute FSM_reg_0_ attributeName
For example: get_attribute FSM_reg_0_ is_sequential
If the FSM_reg_0_ cell is squential, it will return true

To find all the attributes for cell class, type the following command 
list_attribute -application -class cell

Like the cell class, there are other classes, such as design, port, cell, clock, pin, net, lib, or reference

To return a list of all sequential cells, type the following command.

set allCells [get_object_name [get_cells -filter {is_sequential==true}]]

Here, allCells is a list, not collection

To get the length of the allCells list, type 
llength llength $allCells

To access the list element at index 1, type 
lindex $allCells 1

To append to a list, type 
lappend allCells newCellName
Note that, while using the lappend command, we didn't use $ sign in front of the allCells. However, while accessing the element and determining the lenght of the list, we used the $ sign. It is very important to remember.
